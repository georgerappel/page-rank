## Page Rank Python

A python implementation of Google's Page Rank algorithm, created as a university project for the Linear Algebra course


Change the variables with the CSV file path/name, the home domain name, and run:

`python ranker.py`

The `numeric_logic_test.py` uses a numerical example between 4 pages with links to test the agortihm implementation.

The `ranked_colaboratory.py` file is the adapted version to use with [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/), inputing the CSV from a drive file.

### URLs file
Follow the `example_urls.csv` pattern for the input file.
You can use [this git repo](https://github.com/georgerappel/domain-links-scraper) to scrape a domain and get a CSV file just like the example.
